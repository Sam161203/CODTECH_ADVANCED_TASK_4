Introduction
The Advanced Encryption Tool is a secure application designed to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES algorithm with customizable hash algorithms. This tool provides both a command-line and a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless file encryption and decryption.

Features
Command-line interface for quick operations.
Graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and CustomTkinter for ease of use.
Supports multiple hash algorithms: MD5, SHA256, SHA512, and SHA1.
Padding to ensure encryption compatibility.
Encryption with secure salt and IV generation.
Visual progress and user feedback for operations.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Cryptographic Libraries:
cryptography for AES encryption.
hashes for hash algorithm support.
GUI Libraries:
tkinter for core GUI.
customtkinter for enhanced styling.
Others:
pyfiglet for ASCII art in CLI.
colorama for colored CLI output.
